# 🚀 Node.js Demo App CI/CD Pipeline

This project demonstrates a **complete CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** and **Docker** for a simple Node.js web application.

## 📦 Features

✅ Node.js web app that runs on port **3000**  
✅ **CI/CD Workflow**: Build, test, and deploy on push to `main`  
✅ **Docker image** built and pushed to **Docker Hub**  
✅ **Docker container** tested during the pipeline
